# AI Tutor Avatar - Project Documentation

## Overview
An AI-powered tutoring application that uses PDF-based concept extraction, adaptive MCQ testing, and HeyGen avatar explanations for incorrect answers. Supports both authenticated users (with Replit Auth) and guest mode.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Wouter (routing)
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **AI Services**: 
  - Gemini (concept extraction, question generation, tutor explanations)
  - HeyGen (avatar video explanations)
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect)

### Key Features
1. **Dual Mode Support**: Authenticated users get progress tracking; guest users can try without accounts
2. **PDF/DOCX Processing**: Upload PDFs or DOCX files → extract text → Gemini extracts concepts → generates MCQs
3. **Assessment-Then-Teaching Flow**: 
   - Assessment phase: Quiz shows only correct/incorrect feedback (no explanations)
   - Teaching phase: After quiz, avatar teaches ONLY the concepts user got wrong
4. **Spaced Repetition**: Questions prioritized by concept weakness (incorrect answer frequency)
5. **Avatar Explanations**: HeyGen avatar delivers warm, supportive explanations for weak concepts
6. **Progress Dashboard**: Track learning, identify weak areas, view history (available to all users)

## Data Model

### Core Tables
- `users` - User accounts via Replit Auth
- `sessions` - Session storage for Replit Auth
- `pdfs` - Uploaded documents (linked to userId or guestSessionId)
- `concepts` - AI-extracted concepts from PDFs
- `questions` - Generated MCQs for each concept
- `quiz_sessions` - Individual quiz attempts
- `answers` - Student answers with explanations

### User Flows

**Guest User Flow:**
1. Land on homepage → "Try as Guest"
2. Upload PDF/DOCX → AI processes → generates quiz
3. Take quiz (assessment) → see only correct/incorrect feedback
4. After quiz → review session teaches concepts where answers were wrong
5. Avatar explains each incorrect concept with warm, supportive guidance
6. View dashboard with progress (stored locally via guestSessionId)

**Authenticated User Flow:**
1. Sign in via Replit Auth
2. Upload PDF/DOCX → stored with userId
3. Take quiz (assessment) → progress tracked in database
4. After quiz → review session for incorrect answers with avatar
5. View dashboard with stats, weak concepts, history
6. Return anytime with saved progress
